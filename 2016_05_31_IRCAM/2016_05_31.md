# [fit]_this will be changed and made solid II_

- Different conception of material
- Requires different nature of notational intermediation

^ musical intentions:
Musically: 
- the networked intensity of chamber music
- make that the material
- as such, abstract musical material disintegrates
Notationally:
- specific color -> 3D physical placement

---

^ 
- achieve the complexity of the energies that i was after
- required a different conception of material
- and therefore shifts of medium of representation

---

### Mapping of graphical space and color space</br>to physical space

Example: right-hand:

- Line width: bow pressure
- Color: bow contact point 
	- _molto sul ponticello_ ... _molto sul tasto_
- Vertical position: bow position

# [fit]Issues of portability with these strategies for notation

- Colors print unreliably
	- Different colors print with varying success
	- Very noticeable in small objects due to "misregistration"

- Gray values print unreliably
	- Particularly in very small contexts
	- Very noticeable due to "half-toning"

---

# [fit]Issues of portability with these strategies for notation

- For my purposes, printing was unreliable.

- Particularly problematic when colors and gray values are mapped directly to musical information.

- Thus, if the printing differs, the musical material is actually changed.

---

---

# [fit]Issues with process of implementing these strategies

- The scores took too long to make (300–600hr)

- Each of the scores authored with a combination of
	- MakeMusic _Finale_
	- Adobe _Illustrator_
	- Each having incompatible ideologies for displaying information

- Making it functionally impossible to modify a score
	- Impacting compositional decisions and process

---

# [fit]Issues with process of implementing these strategies

To make this all more frustrating, the score authoring process was all quite systematic.

---

# First steps

- Scripting into Illustrator

	- Provided testing ground for graphic design of notational elements

#Proof of Concept: _deserving of Songs_

^ At this point, I was looking to enrich the purely graphical notational strategies of _THIS WILL BE CHANGED AND MADE SOLID_
